plot phase curves with spherical harmonics (debug??)
run spherical harmonics mcmc for hst white lc and Spitzer

 -  figures from Vivien's data
T/P profiles (Vivien, Mike, and JFort)
correctly normalized BD and planet spectra
composition and albedo from Mike
detection significance of thermal inversion as a function of phase
put chi2 values in the table with eclipse depths

MCMC for spherical harmonics?

Are my error bars consistent with Cartier?
